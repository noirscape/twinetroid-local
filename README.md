# twinetroid-local

A local copy of [twinetroid](https://www.metroid-database.com/wp-content/uploads/Metroid/Twinetroid/Twinetroid.html) from metroid-database.

You can see the horrible script I used to grab the images in grab_images.py, but you really don't need it to run.

All the images are localized, the rest of the HTML/JS was already in-line.

You can also access it on [GitHub Pages](https://noirscape.github.io/twinetroid-local), but you really should support Metroid-Database by using [theirs](https://www.metroid-database.com/wp-content/uploads/Metroid/Twinetroid/Twinetroid.html)

Credits can be found by clicking "credits" on the index.html, but to summarize: Thanks Devin Monnens.

Localized in the event that metroid-database ever goes bust so this can be easily archived somewhere else.

I also manually had to grab these images:

* GodEnd.jpg -> this should be [GoodEnd.jpg](https://www.metroid-database.com/wp-content/uploads/Metroid/Twinetroid/GoodEnd.jpg), which is how it's hosted on the site. Saved as GodEnd.jpg in the images folder to avoid having to adjust the html manually.
* EscapedZebes.jpg -> this should be [EscapeZebes.jpg](https://www.metroid-database.com/wp-content/uploads/Metroid/Twinetroid/EscapeZebes.jpg), which is how it's hosted on the site. Saved as EscapedZebes.jpg in the images folder for the same reason as previous image.
